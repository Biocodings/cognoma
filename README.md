# Project Cognoma

_Putting machine learning in the hands of cancer biologists._

Project Cognoma is collaborative project between the [Greene Lab](http://www.greenelab.com/), the [DataPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) & the [Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/) meetups, and anyone else who would like to participate. We're building a web application that will give cancer biologists an easy way to build and apply machine learning models.

## July 5th Meetup Recap

On July 5th, we hosted a [datathon workshop](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/events/232137908/"DataPhilly & Code for Python July 5th Datathon Meetup") introducing Neo4j and this project. [**@gwaygenomics**](https://github.com/gwaygenomics "Greg Way on GitHub") presented the biological motivation behind Project Cognoma ([slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4btewka0icgse4f/DatathonWorkshop_5July2016_Final.pptx?dl=0)) and [**@dhimmel**](https://github.com/dhimmel "Daniel Himmelstein on GitHub") discussed Hetionet and the Cypher query language ([slides](http://slides.com/dhimmel/datathon)).

Thanks everyone who attended. The response, excitement, and diverse talents were highly encouraging. This following week, we'll work to hammer out project details including:

+ information on contributing and getting involved
+ a more detailed project outline
+ specifications for the various project components
+ a list of skillsets needed
+ a higher-level description of project goals

Check back here for more details. In the meantime, feel free to open issues with feedback, suggestions, or questions. This is a community oriented project, so don't hesitate to chime in â€” you can [introduce yourself here](https://github.com/cognoma/cognoma/issues/2 "Issue #2: Introduce yourself here to get involved").
