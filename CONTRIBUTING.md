# Contributing to a Project Cognoma Repository

## Project Philosophy

Project Cognoma is an open source community-based project. Beyond our immediate scientific aspirations, we want to engage as many individuals as possible in doing cool work. Project Cognoma is a place to learn and grow as a community. So don't be shy. We want your contribution. Given the nature of open source development, not all contributions can be included … but all will be appreciated and help the project bloom.

## Issues

We use GitHub Issues for a wide range of tasks including bug reports, feature requests, planning, and general forum. Don't worry about whether your use of GitHub Issues is legitimate, but do try to pick the best [repository](https://github.com/cognoma "Repositories of the Cognoma Organization") to file your issue under.

## Pull Requests

Project Cognoma operates on a pull request model. Substantial changes should be submitted via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ "GitHub · Using pull requests"). We also encourage you to comment on and review open pull requests.

To keep the commit history clean, we may ask you to [rebase your pull request](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request "How to Rebase a Pull Request") or squash certain commits. If you don't know what this means, we'll help you through the process.

**Happy Contributing!**

## Commit Access

Currently, [members](https://github.com/orgs/cognoma/people "Cognoma People") of the `cognoma` GitHub organization have commit access on all [cognoma repositories](https://github.com/cognoma). However, our goal is to transition to sustainable project development without the direct need for organization involvement. Therefore, organization members will grant (and revoke) commit access on a per repository level. For example, a Django developer working on [`cognoma/django-cognoma`](https://github.com/cognoma/django-cognoma) will receive commit access to `cognoma/django-cognoma` but not necessarily `cognoma/cognoma`. Commit access will be extended based on a history of positive involvement in the project. Commit access should be used for two purposes:

1. Small or urgent changes where discussion or code review does not make sense.
2. Merging pull requests that have undergone review. The committer should use their best judgment on how how much review is necessary for a given pull request. For some pull requests, a single individual with commit access may be able to fully review a pull request.

If you think Project Cognoma would benefit from granting you commit access, please contact an [organization member](https://github.com/orgs/cognoma/people "Cognoma People"). However, please don't request commit access until you've accumulated a history of involvement in the project.
